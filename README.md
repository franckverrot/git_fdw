# PostgreSQL Git Foreign Data Wrapper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/franckverrot/git_fdw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/franckverrot/git_fdw)

git\_fdw is a Git Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL written in C.

It is making use of [`libgit2`](libgit2.github.com).

## INSTALLATION

### Prerequisites

* libgit2-dev (supports up to v0.27)
* PostgreSQL 9.4+
  * `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` doesn't exist with 9.4, please use `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` instead.


### Building the extension

#### With PGXN

Simply run

    pgxn install git_fdw

#### From source

Building git\_fdw is as simple as

    make

and installing it only requires oneself to

    make install


### Configuring the Foreign Data Wrapper

Now you can start setting up your environment to access git repositories:

    franck=# CREATE EXTENSION git_fdw;
    CREATE EXTENSION

    franck=# CREATE SERVER git_fdw_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER git_fdw;
    CREATE SERVER


With the support of `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` in PostgreSQL 9.5+:

    franck=# IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA git_data
             FROM SERVER git_fdw_server
             INTO public
             OPTIONS (
                 path   '/git_fdw/repo.git',
                 branch 'refs/heads/master',
                 prefix 'rails_'
             );

`LIMIT TO` and `EXCEPT` are not supported.


With PostgreSQL 9.4:

    franck=# CREATE FOREIGN TABLE
        rails_repository (
            sha1          text,
            message       text,
            name          text,
            email         text,
            commit_date   timestamp with time zone,
            insertions    int,
            deletions     int,
            files_changed int
        )
        SERVER git_fdw_server
        OPTIONS (
            path   '/home/franck/rails.git',
            branch 'refs/heads/master'
        );
    CREATE FOREIGN TABLE


    franck=# SELECT message, name FROM rails_repository LIMIT 10;
                             message                          |          name

It is not possible to access multiple repositories through the same foreign
table. We suggest the usage of views if this is something that needs to be
achieved.

## CONFIGURATION

### Server

There are no options that can be passed to a git\_fdw server.

### Foreign Table

One must configure the foreign tables appropriately.

Here are the options:

  * (Required) `path`: The path of the git repository;
  * (Required) `branch`: The branch to be used;
  * (Optional) `git_search_path`: Sometimes libgit2 has to be told where to find your configuration. See #10 for details.

## Contributing

### Patches/Pull Requests workflow

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with version or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.


### How to run the tests

The project has been configured to run on Travis CI automatically, but one can
run tests manually with those simple steps (more details in the `.travis.yml`
file):

    export PG_VERSION=12

    # Build the docker image
    docker build -f tests/Dockerfiles/$PG_VERSION -t my_git_fdw .

    # Run the tests in the container and mount the current directory inside of the
    # container at /git_fdw
    #
    # This makes it possible to update the dynamic files (like the .sql files)
    # without having to rebuild the whole image.
    docker run --rm --volume `pwd`:/git_fdw my_git_fdw tests/run.sh $PG_VERSION
